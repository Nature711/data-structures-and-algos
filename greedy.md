## Overview

- builds up a solution piece by piece
- always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit
- the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are the best fit for Greedy


## Example questions
1. Fractional knapsack
   - local optimal strategy: choose the item that has maximum value vs weight ratio
   - leads to globally optimal solution because we are allowed to take fractions of an item
2. Activity Selection
