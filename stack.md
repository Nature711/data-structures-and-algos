## Properties 

- LIFO -- last in first out

## Use cases
### processing from outside to inwards
- mirroring the recurisve structure of some problems
- delay evaluation of outer layer; evaluate immediately when hitting "base case"
e.g. 
- [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/solution/)
- [Decode String](https://github.com/Nature711/my-leetcode-notes/edit/master/0394-decode-string/NOTES.md)

### "undo" some operation
- where the operation to be undone is the "most recent" one -- pop from stack
e.g.
- [Backspace String Comparison](https://github.com/Nature711/my-leetcode-notes/blob/master/0844-backspace-string-compare/NOTES.md)
