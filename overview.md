# Intro to data structures 

## What & Why
- Motivation: human works with different types of data for different tasks
  - e.g., dictionaries (sorted lists), city maps (geometries), cash books (tabular schema)
- DS is a way to store and organize data in a **computer**, so that it can be **used efficiently**

## Abstract Data Types (ADT)
- ADTs define data and operations (logical view, abstraction) without implementation details
  - e.g., lists, abstractly defined for storing, read, modifying elements
- Implementations provide concrete types with detailed functionality
  - list (ADT) is implemented using array in many programming languages
- Studying data structures involves examining logical views, available operations, and their costs.
